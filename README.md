This application is intended to be used in conjunction with the Python Client application, 
another one of my repositories. It is meant to be a control system for an optical testbed 
that uses an android phone as the image source. This App allows the user to send images
over TCP sockets when the user is connected via USB port to a host machine. The images
that are received over the socket will then be displayed on the android screen. Note that
this application will only work on newer phones with OLED pixels EG. Samsung Galaxy S7.
The app itself is relatively robust and can be used for more than just low light imaging.
